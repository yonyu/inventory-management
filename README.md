# Craete this project with Redux Toolkit TypeScript

Command to create this project

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-redux inventory-management
```

It has some example code that shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

**Redux Toolkit** (also known as "RTK" for short) provides a standardized way to write Redux logic. It includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including [store setup](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore), [creating reducers and writing immutable update logic](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer), and even [creating entire "slices" of state at once](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice). This example showcases each of these features in conjunction with Next.js.
